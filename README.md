# Project 1a: Mindfulness and Multitasking
The goal of our project is to determine whether practicing mindfulness has a significant effect on someone's ability to multitask.


## The Test Website
In order to test the multitasking abilities of participants in this study, we have designed a website using the Django framework, based on Python.

The *Mindless* website (deployed at [mindless-app.com](http://mindless-app.com)) is a database-driven application that allows us, the project coordinators, to add and remove participants and other study information at our will.

The data currently stored on the site is test data, and thus the site may be used as one wishes. Depending on where the participant last left off, selecting a participant will resume at different pages in the site.

## The Android Application
To run the application
1. Clone the repository
2. Open Android Studio version 3.1.4 or higher, if you don't have it, download it from https://developer.android.com/studio/
3. When downloading, choose to download a virtual device with Android KitKat (4.4) or higher - if you don't want to download a virtual device, you need to have access to a phone with Android version KitKat (4.4) or higher
3. In Android studio: File >> Open >> [[the root folder of the git repository >> mindless >> mindlessapp]]
4. Once the build finishes, run the application by clicking the green triangle on the top tool bar or through the keyboard shortcut (Shift+F10)
5. Choose a virtual device if you decided to install one, or, connect your Android phone to the pc via USB. You should be able to run on there

## Data Analysis

Once we gather pilot data and real data from participants we will need to analyse and draw conclusions from this data in order to come up with findings to be presented in our final report.

Statistical data involves the mouse movement of the participants, time taken for each task, number of clicks, number of incorrect clicks and other statistics which vary with respect to which game is being played.
